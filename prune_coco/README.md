# LTH for object recognition
This repo is the official implementation for the CVPR submission **#10479**

Note: This repo is built upon Facebook's open source detectron2 library. hence we have retained the copyright and the author notices from the original repo. Weâ€™ll update these when making the repo public.

# Installation
For installing the required dependecies to run this repo, please refer to the [detectron_README](detectron_README.md) document provided by detectron2 and follow the steps. 

# File Structure
The different parts/experiments require switching different options in this repository through the ```MODE``` flag in config. The general structure is as follows:
```tools/train_net.py ```:  The main python script to execute for all forms of training and eval. 
```tools/lth.py``` : The LTH class which controls the functions relating to applying LTH on the object recognition models. 
```detectron2/configs/defaults.py```: Contains details about the various parameters that needs to be passed while running ```train_net.py```

# Running experiments
## Direct pruning
Example way to run: 
Here we are training a keypoint detector model with Resnet18 backbone and  with 40% sparsity using direct pruning (all layers are pruned). 
Additional configs are found in ```configs/``` directory.

```
 python tools/train_net.py --num-gpus 4 --resume \
   --config-file configs/COCO-Keypoints/keypoint_rcnn_r18_FPN_1x.yaml \
 	SOLVER.BASE_LR 0.015 \
 	SOLVER.WARMUP_ITERS 2000 \
 	 SOLVER.WARMUP_FACTOR 5e-4 \
 	LOTTERY_KEEP_PERCENTAGE 0.6 \
 	NUM_ROUNDS 2 \
 	OUTPUT_DIR temp/
 	MODE lottery
```


## Transfer tickets
Example:
To train a Resnet-18 keypoint detector with pruned imagnet backbone (transferred) at 90% sparsity. 

```
python tools/train_net.py --num-gpus 2 --resume \
  --config-file configs/COCO-Keypoints/keypoint_rcnn_r18_FPN_1x.yaml \
	SOLVER.BASE_LR 0.015 \
	SOLVER.WARMUP_ITERS 2000 \
	 SOLVER.WARMUP_FACTOR 5e-4 \
	NUM_ROUNDS 2 \
	IMAGENET_TICKET resources/resnet_18_ticket_10.pth \
	IMAGENET_TICKET_TYPE res18 \
	OUTPUT_DIR temp/ \
	MODE transfer_imagenet 
```
## Pruning only backbone
Here we report numbers related to directly pruning only the backbone of the network, for both detection and keypoint estimation tasks. 
The command below trains a resnet18 keypoint model with **50% sparsity in its backbone network**.
```
python tools/train_net.py --num-gpus 2 --resume \
  --config-file configs/COCO-Keypoints/keypoint_rcnn_r18_FPN_1x.yaml \
	SOLVER.BASE_LR 0.015 \
	SOLVER.WARMUP_ITERS 2000 \
	 SOLVER.WARMUP_FACTOR 5e-4 \
	LOTTERY_KEEP_PERCENTAGE 0.5 \
	NUM_ROUNDS 2 \
	OUTPUT_DIR temp/  \
	LATE_RESET_CKPT  resources/keypoint_r18_fpn_base/model_0003534.pth \
	MODEL.WEIGHTS  resources/keypoint_r18_fpn_base/model_final.pth \
	TEST.COMPUTE_FLOPS True \
	MODE prune_backbone
```
In this branch, we can also set ```TEST.COMPUTE_FLOPS``` argument to ```True``` to obtain flops and memory of the model. 

## Mask transfer
To run experiments where only mask (not values) is transferred from imagenet models. 
Example: Training a resnet50 backbone detector where the backbone mask is transferred with 90% sparsity. 
```
python tools/train_net.py --num-gpus 2 --resume \
      --config-file  configs/COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_1x.yaml \
	SOLVER.WARMUP_ITERS 2000 \
	 SOLVER.WARMUP_FACTOR 5e-4\
	LOTTERY_KEEP_PERCENTAGE 0.01\
	NUM_ROUNDS 2\
	OUTPUT_DIR temp/ \
	LATE_RESET_CKPT  resources/mask_r50_fpn_base/model_0007329.pth \
	MODEL.WEIGHTS  resources/mask_r50_fpn_base/model_final.pth \
	MODE mask_transfer

```
## Task Transfer
To run experiments relating to transferring masks across __tasks__. 
Example:
Code to train a Res18 keypoint detector with 80% sparsity, with the mask being obtained from the corresponding detection task. 
```
python tools/train_net.py --num-gpus 2 --resume \
  --config-file configs/COCO-Keypoints/keypoint_rcnn_r18_FPN_1x.yaml \
	SOLVER.BASE_LR 0.015 \
	SOLVER.WARMUP_ITERS 5000 \
	 SOLVER.WARMUP_FACTOR 2e-4 \
	NUM_ROUNDS 2 \
	OUTPUT_DIR temp/ \
	SOURCE_TASK det \
	SOURCE_MODEL  output/mask_rcnn_r18_prune_20_late/model_0007329.pth \
	MODE task_transfer
```
